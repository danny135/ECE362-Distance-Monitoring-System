# ECE362-Distance-Monitoring-System

This project uses the Freescale 9S12C32 Microcontroller, two short range ultrasonic sensors, and one long range ultrasonic sensor.

The end result is a distance monitoring system that can be used to retrofit older cars (two sensors in the front, one short range sensor in the back). The system works like collision alert systems in modern cars. This is only assistive technology, it does not control the car.
